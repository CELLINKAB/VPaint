VPaint is a research prototype that was written as a proof-of-concept
while developing the
[Vector Animation Complex](http://www.borisdalstein.com/research/vac/)
technology. It is not maintained anymore.

If you are interested in this technology, please checkout our new
project [VGC Software](https://github.com/vgc-io/vgc)! It is basically
a reimplementation from scratch of VPaint, providing better stability,
performance, and long-term sustainability.
